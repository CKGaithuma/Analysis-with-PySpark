# Analysis-with-PySpark
This repository contains two notebooks that I created for my Data Science class. 

The first notebook `main.ipynb` contains the following:
- General information on how Spark works
- How to create a Spark session
- How to read data into Spark
- How to create and manipulate a Spark DataFrame
- How to use Spark SQL to query data
- How to use Spark ML to create a machine learning model

The second notebook `lowLevel.ipynb` is a notebook that is meant to achieve the following:
- Create a Spark Context
- Read data into Spark RDDs
- Manipulate Spark RDDs
- Perform MapReduce operations on Spark RDDs

These notebooks are meant to be used in conjunction with the `data` folder. It contains the dataset used for both querying the data and creating the machine learning model.

Please set up your environment to run these notebooks. I used the following
1. Python 3.10.12
2. Spark 3.4.1
3. Java 1.8.0_319
4. PySpark 3.4.1

If you feel that you need a code alone, please feel free to use the corresponing `student*` files as they contain blank cells for you to fill in.
